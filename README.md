# INTRODUCTION-TO-PYTHON-PROGRAMMING
WORK IN PROGRESS

The germ and initial set of files of this project comprises the following material prepared by this contributor:
- the set of Lecture Notes used in Semester 1 of the module INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS (U24200) during the years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021,
- as well as the set of solutions to exercises appearing in these original Lecture Notes.

I will be building upon this material in the forthcoming months.
